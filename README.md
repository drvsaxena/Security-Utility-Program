# Security Utility Program

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **Java-based Encryption and Decryption tool** that uses **XOR logic** with a secret key. It can securely convert plain text into encrypted format and back to original form with the same key. The project is lightweight, fast, and demonstrates the core idea of symmetric key cryptography.

## 🔑 Features  
- Encrypts text using a secret key  
- Decrypts encrypted text back to original  
- Symmetric key based (same key for both operations)  
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly  
- Useful for learning **basic cryptography concepts**  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Java** (Core Java, StringBuilder, XOR operations)  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Input a text message.  
2. Apply XOR operation with a secret key.  
3. Output will be **encrypted**.  
4. Running XOR again with the same key returns the **decrypted text**.
